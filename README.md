Yaml to ERD Generator
=====================

This is a basic entity relationship diagram (ERD) generator designed for data models that include the row key/column family/column qualifier structure (e.g. HBase, Accumulo). It generates a graphviz (.gv) file using Javascript and Node.js, then parses it using graphviz (dot and neato) into a png file.

This project may one day be a Node module, but it is not this day.
